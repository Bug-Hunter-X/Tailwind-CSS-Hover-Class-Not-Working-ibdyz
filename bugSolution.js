// Solution: Ensure no conflicting CSS rules are overriding the hover state.
// Verify your Tailwind CSS configuration is correct and that the hover pseudo-class is functioning correctly.

// Consider using !important (use cautiously!) as a last resort if specificity issues persist.
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700 p-4 rounded-lg">
  Hover over me!
